# ng-conf-memory-leaks
The large application you’ve been building is finally in production, and as it goes with all freshly launched apps, you are getting complaints from your first users. There seems to be a memory leak in your application, but where do you even start to look? In this talk we’ll go over some of the causes you don’t often find mentioned. You’ve read about DOM nodes not being released, but what does that mean in an Angular app? Your debugging tools you forgot to remove could be the cause of all of your anguish. I will show you how to keep your sanity and actually stop the leak
